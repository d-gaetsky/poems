Today is only magic night
I've ever felt since born.
However, loneliness make me die
and also make me grown;

Whatever have I : wind's kiss,
Or gently touch from shine,
I can't express it, how I miss
For you, in land of wine!

In land of sun, and hush, and hot
 romantic is an air,
And every stone, every spot
reminds me: you are there!

Today is only magic night
That have my soul flown.
I feel you're near, close my eyes...
So sorry, I'm alone.
